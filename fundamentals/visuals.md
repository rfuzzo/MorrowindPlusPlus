{% hint style="info" %}
Pure texture replacer mods are generally compatible with everything and can be added or removed mid-playthrough. This mod list is somewhat light on texture mods because I like the vanilla aesthetics of **Intelligent Textures** and that's why this is the baseline and not much else is added. Feel free to install any texture replacer at will.
{% endhint %}
