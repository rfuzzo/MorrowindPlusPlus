Changes the effects of Blight Diseases to make them more interesting and unique, rather than just more potent versions of the common diseases.

‚≠ê [**Running Fatigue Overhaul**](https://github.com/rfuzzo/MorrowindPlusPlus/blob/main/assets/RunningFatigue_Overhaul_Beta.7z) by Pherim\
Running and Swimming uses much less Fatigue, but Fatigue regenerates slower

[**Written in the Stars - a birthsign mod**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50378)\
Each birthsign now has a few variants (including the original one) for a grand total of 40 new lore-friendly birthsigns.

[**Weapon Sheathing - Bow Position Edit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/48473)\
Tweaks bows so that they line up better with the sheathing animation.

[**Weapon Sheathing Additions**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/49616)\
Adds sheaths to weapons not covered by Weapon Sheathing.

[**Empowered Enchantments by Caleb**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53881)\
Most enchantments have been revamped. Many cast on use enchantments are now constant effects, with more appropriate (but not fun sucking) balancing so they aren't TOO crazy. Many cast on use enchantments have also been buffed, to make it worth going through a bunch of menus and raising your hands and casting them.

[**Empowered Potions by Caleb**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/53879)\
Most potions have been rebalanced to give you more noticeable effects. Plus, alcohol gets a new mechanic to control its consumption. My goal with this mod is to finally get someone to drink a swift swim potion.

[**East Vvardenfell Travel Service**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/50126)\
This mod adds 6 caravaner travel services to the eastside of Vvardenfell. Helping to fill out the vanilla services with land based travel in the Grazelands and Molag Amur. Simple, balanced, useful.

[**Expanded Birthsigns for Purists**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/18016)\
This has been on PES for a year now, I figured it was about time to put it up on TES Nexus. Expanded Birthsigns for Purists rebalances and expands the original birthsigns while retaining lore-purity, based on the in-game text \'The Firmament\', and the birthsigns available in Oblivion, doubling the number of birthsigns from thirteen to twenty-six.

[**Spells Reforged**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/18016)\
